# hello-world
hello-world repo for task1 of CS 361

  Saluations sapient being! You are sapient, right? I'd hate to write this only to have it be read by ai.
My name is Maxwell Russell, this is the README.md file for a hello-world program. I'm assuming that you
are a professor or TA for CS361, if not I question your decision to spend your time reading hello-world
files on random GitHub repos. But I don't judge, we all have strange hobbies after all. I would ask you
how you are doing, but you have no way to answer. So instead I will ask you to tell the next person you
meet the last thing that you ate. That way you will be involved in some human-human interaction (also
known as social interaction). Alternatively, you could ask the next person you see this riddle:

    Raised for the great,
    Dug for their fall,
    Filled with their treasure,
    Then kept by their hall.
    What is it?
    
  Before I give you the answer I want you to try and figure it out yourself. Go on, take a few minutes to
ponder what it could be. I'll wait...

  So have you made your guess? Are you sure? Well the answer to this riddle can be a few things. The
answer I considere to be correct is: A Barrow. However, any type of burial structure which involves/could
involve the inclusion of grave goods with the inturred can be considered correct.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.
